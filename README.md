# CompLING Lab Internship Practice
This repository contains a set of tasks to help you practice your coding skills.
Each task is designed to help you get started with one specific research project with [Freda](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fhs/) and the CompLING Lab.
Your work on the task will be part of your application.
Your application will be evaluated based on the quality of your work on the task.
Due to the large amount of applications, only outstanding applications will be considered for interviews, and we unfortunately cannot offer individual feedback.
