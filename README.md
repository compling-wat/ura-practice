# CL Lab Internship Practice
This repository contains a set of tasks to help you practice your coding skills.
Each task is designed to help you get started with one specific research project with [Freda](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fhs/) and the CL lab through the Waterloo Undergrad Research Assistant (URA) Program.

**Note to UW Co-Op Applicants**:
Please apply for URA first and work with us for at least three months. Freda will be happy to take outstanding URAs from the group as co-op students.

**Note to Non-UW Students**:
You are welcome to complete these tasks.
Although Freda is not looking for onsite visiting students or interns before Fall 2024, she will have openings starting Fall 2024 through the [Vector Internship Program](https://vectorinstitute.ai/programs/internships/), the [Mitacs Globalink Program](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-internship-students/), or direct admissions.
