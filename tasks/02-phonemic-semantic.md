## Question 2

Historical linguistics is a subject studying diachronic language change, including changes in the history of a single language, or changes revealed in the comparison of related languages. (Campbell, 2013)  

A word’s **etymology** is the history of the linguistic changes it has undergone. (Campbell, 2013) In this question, you will investigate the etymology of several words, and develop a sense of “the history of language units”. Note that the scope of historical linguistics extends far beyond etymology or the history of individual words; nevertheless, accurate etymology is an important product of historical linguistic work.

For the following pairs of English words, please refer to etymological dictionary (eg: [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/)) to trace the origins. Briefly discuss **whether or not each pair is etymologically related.** 

> Hint: You may find it useful to learn about the Indo-European language family tree to better understand the relationships.

**Word Pairs:**

1. peace, pay
2. ward, guard
3. much, multi
