## Task A2: Discussing English Etymology

Historical linguistics is a subject studying diachronic language change, including changes in the history of a single language, or changes revealed in the comparison of related languages.

A word’s **etymology** is the history of the linguistic changes it has undergone (Campbell, 2013).
In this question, you will investigate the etymology of several words, and develop a sense of “the history of language units.”
Note that the scope of historical linguistics extends far beyond etymology or the history of individual words; nevertheless, accurate etymology is an important product of historical linguistic work.

For the following pairs of English words, please refer to etymological dictionary (e.g.: [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/)) to trace the origins.
Briefly discuss **whether or not each pair is etymologically related.**
For each pair, the discussion should be within 500 words.

> Hint: You may find it useful to learn about the Indo-European language family tree to better understand the relationships.

**Word Pairs:**

1. peace, pay
2. ward, guard
3. much, multi

### Follow-Up Idea Discussion
Describe a potential research idea you would like to work with us, which is built on top of this and uses computational methods. Please list the required resource and how to obtain them (e.g., collecting Wiktionary data with a web scraper, or using some existing dumps of Wiktionary, or using open-sourced or proprietary large language models).
